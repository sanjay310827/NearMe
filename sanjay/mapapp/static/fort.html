        <h4>The Sadras Dutch Fort is a partially ruined, ASI-protected monument in Tamil Nadu, India, originally built by the Dutch for commerce and defense, featuring a large granary and stables now mostly gone. The surviving structures, including strong laterite walls and bastions, alongside a well-maintained Dutch cemetery with 17th and 18th-century graves, offer insight into the fort's commercial and military history before its capture by the British in 1818. </h4>
